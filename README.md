week 3 challenge - bootstrap portfolio


## Description 

A mock portfolio website that is powered by Bootstrap and uses Bootstrap CSS framework. 
The website follows accessibility standards, so that the website can be optimised in searh engines. 
The loaded page presents the portfolio with a navigation bar, navigation menu at the top, a hero section using a jumbotron featuring a profile picture with name and additional information. The work section displays projects within a grid using Bootstrap cards and information about each project. Additional sections include contact box, skills, an about me section and a footer with clickable links.
